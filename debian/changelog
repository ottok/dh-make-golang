dh-make-golang (0.3.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 0.3.3:
    - Remove unneeded golang-*-dev dependency for program
      This fixes a bug that I introduced in commit 8ed6b21 for v0.1.0
    - Fix erroneous reference to --include-upstream-history
      in the instruction; should be --upstream-git-history instead.
    - Remove "# TODO: publish under debian-go-team/ci"
      from debian/gitlab-ci.yml, as I believe that has already been done,
      and so that its TODO would not confuse the packager.
    - Add "Upstream-Contact: TODO" to generated debian/copyright
      as mentors.debian.net seems to require this field, and if missing,
      would display the following warning:
          RFS: author info missing
          Upstream-Contact: was not found in d/copyright.
          RFS will not autocomplete the Upstream author.
    - Move Build-Depends-{Arch,Indep} back into Build-Depends.
      For Go packages, golang-any and dependencies are always needed
      regardless of whether we are building a program or a library,
      and it is not like we need e.g. texinfo to build *-doc packages,
      so the use Build-Depends-Arch and Build-Depends-Indep served
      no purpose other than unnecessarily complicating things.
    - template: Add "dversionmangle=s/\+ds\d*$//,repacksuffix=+ds1"
      to debian/watch if Files-Excluded is added to debian/copyright
    - Add honnef.co as "honnef" to knownHosts
    - Print dh-make-golang version at the start of make

dh-make-golang (0.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 0.3.2:
    - Refactor shortHostName:
      Move knownHosts to a map to simplify the code,
      and fix the publicsuffix guess, input should be fqdn.
    - Sort the knownHosts list in alphabetical order
    - Add {sigs,}k8s.io, "gocloud" (gocloud.dev), sourcehut (git.sr.ht),
      and "uber" (go.uber.org) to knownHosts.
    - Fix version detection for multi-module repo.
    - Download upstream tarball from GitHub or GitLab
      if so resolved by vcs.RepoRootForImportPath().
    - Update Standards-Version to 4.5.0
    - Fix ineffectual assignment to err in tarballFromHoster()
    - Manage MIT (Expat) license too
    - Remove unneeded golang-*-dev dependency for program.
      Fixes a bug that was introduced in commit 8ed6b21 for v0.1.0
  * Bump Standards-Version to 4.5.0 (no change)

dh-make-golang (0.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 0.3.1:
    - Generate debian/gitlab-ci.yml too.
    - Add remote "origin" to point to Salsa in .git/config
      to save the user from doing so manually.
    - Preconfigure git branches just as "git clone" and "gbp clone" would do.
      Thanks to Antoine Beaupre for the suggestion!  (Closes: #921536)
    - List full path of /usr/sbin/sendmail in final instructions
      so that the end developer can copy-and-paste to send ITP mail
      without using sudo.
    - Fix -allow_unknown_hoster parsing error in make.go.
      Thanks to James Montgomery for the fix!  (Closes: #947512)
    - Sort dependency list like wrap-and-sort, i.e. place variables
      such as ${misc:Depends} and ${shlibs:Depends} at the end of the list.
      Thanks to Arnaud Rebillout for the suggestion!

dh-make-golang (0.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 0.3.0:
    "dh-make-golang" now includes the full upstream git history
    by default as recommended by Debian Go Packaging Teamâ€™s new workflow,
    see https://go-team.pages.debian.net/workflow-changes.html.
    This is still somewhat experimental, so all feedback is welcome!

dh-make-golang (0.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 0.2.0
    - Prefer upstream tagged release version over master (HEAD),
      and download upstream release tarball if available,
      just like what uscan would do with our default debian/watch.
    - Add -force-prerelease flag to revert to old behaviour
      of always choosing @master (git HEAD) over @latest tagged version.
    - Generate debian/watch to track git HEAD if upstream has never
      tagged any release.
    - Fix missing long description for non-GitHub import path
      when "go-source" meta tag actually resolves to GitHub.
    - Add gitlab.com hoster as "gitlab".
    - Add blitiri.com.ar hoster as "blitiri".

dh-make-golang (0.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 0.1.1:

      the pristine-tar branch is actually created if requested
    - Stop adding "Files-Excluded: Godeps/_workspace" to debian/copyright
      if no such directory exists upstream
    - Suppress "Switched to a new branch 'debian/sid'" message
    - Use fmt.Printf() instead of log.Printf() for final instructions

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Nov 2019 07:10:56 -0700

dh-make-golang (0.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

      library and program.  Run "dh-make-golang make -help" for details.
  * Change debian/watch to track upstream tarball
  * Add debian/gbp.conf and switch master to debian/sid
    for DEP-14 conformance

dh-make-golang (0.0~git20190305.55fc2d0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Afif Elghraoui ]
  * d/control: set minimum required version of golang-any
    the new dependency on golang-github-google-go-github-dev
    needs at least 1.9, so we need it here now as well.

  [ Guillem Jover ]
  * Bump Standards-Version to 4.3.0
  * Build object files under _build/
    By default the build directory is arch-qualified, which means that we
    cannot easily ignore them in places like .gitignore. Use a well-known
    pathname for this.
  * Wrap, sort, indent by one, and add trailing commas to multi-line fields.
    Format fields in a way that minimizes diff output and that makes it
    easier to copy & paste or move lines around between fields:
     - Adding a trailing comma on the last entry makes appending new
       entries not affect the last one.
     - Starting the field value on the next line makes inserting or changing
       the first value generate less diff.
     - Indenting by one space, makes the contents movable between fields,
       and gives a unified format to all such fields.
     - Sorting makes the contents easier to find and easier to avoid
       adding duplicates.
    We cannot currently do this for the Go-Import-Path field, because
    dh-golang does not cope with this file being multi-line with an empty
    first line, yet.
  * Update .gitignore files
  * Set Rules-Requires-Root to no.
    This makes it possible to build packages w/o requiring (pseudo-)root
    privileges.
