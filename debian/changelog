dh-make-golang (0.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 0.7.0

    [ Guillem Jover ]
    * Use new dh-sequence-golang instead of dh-golang and --with=golang

    * Add mongodb to known hosts.
      This is required by the go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver modules.

    * Generate a debian/.gitignore file.
      This helps ignoring artifacts that git should not track, and which it
      can safely clean.

    * Reorder generated fields.

      While stylistic, the rationale for these changes is as follows:

      = debian/control

      - Group Section and Priority together as these categorize the package,
        and place them after Source or Package fields, as this determines
        where in the archive these might end up.
      - Place Maintainer/Uploader after these, as the responsible party for
        the package.
      - Move Rules-Requires-Root before Build-Depends, as this determines
        how to drive the building process, and might impose additional
        dependencies, such as fakeroot or sudo.
      - Move the Testsuite after the Build-Depends, as this is part of the
        runnable metadata.

      = debian/copyright

      - Move the Source field after Format, as both line up, refer to an
        URL, and it's the first reference to the upstream project.

    * Set a Section: TODO field for program packages.
      The golang section is for Go development packages, the fact that a
      program is written in Go is generally of no major relevance for the
      user, and instead a more suitable section relative to its actual
      functionality should be used, to help a proper categorization in the
      archive.

    [ dependabot ]
    * Bump github.com/mattn/go-isatty from 0.0.13 to 0.0.14

    [ Taavi Väänänen ]
    * make: download tarballs from sr.ht
      and add a test for the tarball URL generation.

    [ Anthony Fok ]
    * Bump glamour requirement to get bluemonday v1.0.16
    * Fix empty tarball in case of "unsupported hoster".
      This fixes the error that I introduced on 2021-08-26 in commit 64dccd7
      "Refactor the logic on whether to download upstream tarball"
      Thanks to @mdosch for the report and @creekorful for tips on error
      handling.  Fixes #180, fixes #190 (Closes: #993703, #1064567)
    * Handle salsa.debian.org too in tarballFromHoster()
      to fetch pristine tarball (.gz) instead of compressing our own (.xz)
    * Set u.remote as "salsa" instead of "debian" for salsa.debian.org
      to avoid git remote and git branch containing the same "debian" name
    * Add modernc.org as "modernc" to knownHosts
    * Use https for Apache license link
    * Create dependabot.yml
    * Update .github/workflows/ci-test.yml to test with go1.18
    * Replace deprecated ioutil functions with their io or os equilvalents
    * Add --no-show-signature to "git log --pretty=format:%ct -n1" call
      so the timestamp can be read correctly even if the user has set
      log.showSignature to true in git config. (Closes: #1035321)
    * Bump dependencies:
      - Bump go from 1.16 to 1.21
      - Bump golang.org/x/net from v0.0.0-20210614182718-04defd469f4e to v0.21.0
      - Bump golang.org/x/mod from v0.5.1 to v0.15.0
      - Bump github.com/google/go-github/v38 to github.com/google/go-github/v60
      - Add golang.org/x/tools/go/vcs v0.1.0-deprecated
      - etc.
      Fixes #200, fixes #203
    * ci-test: Bump go version to 1.21 and 1.22 for testing
    * make: Unset GO111MODULE=off so that "go list" works with Go 1.21+.
      This fixes dh-make-golang’s failure to determine dependencies
      since 2023-08-21 when Go 1.21 became the default in Debian.
      (Closes: #1050523)

  * Replace Built-Using field with Static-Built-Using
  * Remove 01-Update-the-import-path-of-golang-github-google-go-github.patch
    and use debian/rules to strip off major version (e.g. v60) from
    github.com/google/go-github/v60/github instead.

  * Team upload.
  * reactivate debian patch
    01-Update-the-import-path-of-golang-github-google-go-github.patch
    and extend to go.mod to allow build using go-github v48.

dh-make-golang (0.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Aloïs Micard ]
  * New upstream version 0.6.0.
  * Add myself as Uploader.
  * Implement clone command to allow easily cloning
    from Salsa and download of upstream .orig.tar.gz
    from FTP archive. This ensure a clean upstream
    tarball will be use.
  * Implement check-depends command to compare dependencies
    between go.mod and d/control.
  * Use new Gitlab CI template.
  * Add software.sslmate.com to knownHosts.

  [ Anthony Fok ]

dh-make-golang (0.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Guillem Jover ]
  * Update default upstream gitignore directories.
    Add _build as that's the default build directory. Anchor both _build
    and .pc under the root source by prefixing with «/». Mark them as
    directories by suffixing with «/».
  * Place license location on the filesystem in a Comment field.
    This is not part of the license statement, it's rather an ancillary
    comment about where to find it.

  [ Peymaneh Nejad ]
  * Add step (go.step.sm) to knownHosts

  [ Federico Grau ]
  * Check for and move upstream debian dir if it exists (Closes: #983241)

  [ Arnaud Rebillout ]
  * Make sure to call normalizeDebianProgramName() on the whole name,
    not on parts.
  * Renaming: normalizeDebian{Program,Package}Name
  * Add testcases to nameFromGoPkg: golang.org/x/term and two others.
  * Update debian-policy link url
  * Set debianBranch in execMake(), use it in createGitRepository()
    This minor refactoring prepares the code for the next commit, where we
    will need to know the Debian branch in `execMake()`.
  * Fix make output: run 'git push' before 'gbp push'
    As mentioned in #107, running 'gbp push' when there's no debian tag is
    not the right thing to do,  as it will only push the upstream branch.
    Consequences are:
    1. The default gitlab branch is set to the upstream branch instead of
       the debian branch.
    2. The debian branch is not pushed and needs to be pushed manually
       anyway.
    I believe that the best thing to do instead is just to run 'git push
    origin <debian-branch>' first, and then run 'gbp push'.
  * Keep compatibility with Git below 2.28.
    Thanks to Alois Micard for pointing that out

  [ Aleksey Morarash ]
  * Extend .gitignore with vim temporary files
  * Annotate errors with context.
    This will prevent situations when program terminates with bare error
    leaving the user without any clue of where the error was occurred.

  [ Anthony Fok ]
  * New upstream version 0.5.0
  * Set GO111MODULE=off when calling "go list" etc.
    to keep dh-make-golang make and estimate working with Go 1.16 and 1.17
  * Add "Multi-Arch: foreign" to library package in debian/control
  * Add Expat (MIT) license text template
  * Recognize upstream pre-release versions so that tilde '~' instead of '-'
    is used in upstream tarball and in debian/changelog, e.g. "1.0.0~rc1"
    instead of "1.0.0-rc.1".  Thanks to nicoo (Closes: #981421)
  * Workaround "go list" error when upstream uses "../.." in import path
    (Closes: #992610)
  * make: Add -program_package_name flag.
    This allows overriding the program package name, and the source package
    name too when appropriate, e.g. to name github.com/cli/cli as "gh".
    See discussion at #951374 https://bugs.debian.org/951374
  * make: Change -force_prerelease and -upstream_git_history flags
    to use underscore instead of hyphen
  * make: Change some wordings in help and instruction, especially
    the use of "git commit -S" for signing the commit
  * Add fyne.io as "fyne" to knownHosts
  * Add filippo.io as "filippo" to knownHosts
  * Fix SA1006 and ST1005 reported by staticcheck
    - ST1005 Incorrectly formatted error string
    - SA1006 Printf with dynamic first argument and no further arguments
  * Migrate from Travis CI to GitHub Actions workflow for CI tests
  * Bump build-dependency on golang-any to (>= 2:1.13~)
    and golang-github-google-go-github-dev to (>= 38)
  * Bump Standards-Version to 4.6.0 (no change)
  * Refresh 01-Update-the-import-path-of-golang-github-google-go-github.patch
    from v32 to v38, but also disable it, as it seems dh-make-golang
    builds just fine with Go 1.15 without the patch.

  * template: Generate debian/upstream/metadata too.  Fixes #144
  * Move debian/man/dh-make-golang.md from Debian packaging

  * Add support for upstream tag that is not <version> or v<version>
    e.g. github.com/lxc/lxd with tag "lxd-4.8", and honnef.co/go/tools
    with tag "2020.1".  Fixes #139 (Closes: #956900)

dh-make-golang (0.3.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 0.3.3:
    - Remove unneeded golang-*-dev dependency for program
      This fixes a bug that I introduced in commit 8ed6b21 for v0.1.0
    - Fix erroneous reference to --include-upstream-history
      in the instruction; should be --upstream-git-history instead.
    - Remove "# TODO: publish under debian-go-team/ci"
      from debian/gitlab-ci.yml, as I believe that has already been done,
      and so that its TODO would not confuse the packager.
    - Add "Upstream-Contact: TODO" to generated debian/copyright
      as mentors.debian.net seems to require this field, and if missing,
      would display the following warning:
          RFS: author info missing
          Upstream-Contact: was not found in d/copyright.
          RFS will not autocomplete the Upstream author.
    - Move Build-Depends-{Arch,Indep} back into Build-Depends.
      For Go packages, golang-any and dependencies are always needed
      regardless of whether we are building a program or a library,
      and it is not like we need e.g. texinfo to build *-doc packages,
      so the use Build-Depends-Arch and Build-Depends-Indep served
      no purpose other than unnecessarily complicating things.
    - template: Add "dversionmangle=s/\+ds\d*$//,repacksuffix=+ds1"
      to debian/watch if Files-Excluded is added to debian/copyright
    - Add honnef.co as "honnef" to knownHosts
    - Print dh-make-golang version at the start of make

    - Refactor shortHostName:
      Move knownHosts to a map to simplify the code,
      and fix the publicsuffix guess, input should be fqdn.
    - Sort the knownHosts list in alphabetical order
    - Add {sigs,}k8s.io, "gocloud" (gocloud.dev), sourcehut (git.sr.ht),
      and "uber" (go.uber.org) to knownHosts.
    - Fix version detection for multi-module repo.
    - Download upstream tarball from GitHub or GitLab

  * New upstream version 0.3.1:
    - Generate debian/gitlab-ci.yml too.
    - Add remote "origin" to point to Salsa in .git/config
      to save the user from doing so manually.
    - Preconfigure git branches just as "git clone" and "gbp clone" would do.
      Thanks to Antoine Beaupre for the suggestion!  (Closes: #921536)
    - List full path of /usr/sbin/sendmail in final instructions
      so that the end developer can copy-and-paste to send ITP mail
      without using sudo.
    - Fix -allow_unknown_hoster parsing error in make.go.
      Thanks to James Montgomery for the fix!  (Closes: #947512)
    - Sort dependency list like wrap-and-sort, i.e. place variables

dh-make-golang (0.0~git20190305.55fc2d0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Afif Elghraoui ]
  * d/control: set minimum required version of golang-any
    the new dependency on golang-github-google-go-github-dev
    needs at least 1.9, so we need it here now as well.

  [ Guillem Jover ]
  * Bump Standards-Version to 4.3.0
  * Build object files under _build/
    By default the build directory is arch-qualified, which means that we
    cannot easily ignore them in places like .gitignore. Use a well-known
    pathname for this.
  * Wrap, sort, indent by one, and add trailing commas to multi-line fields.
    Format fields in a way that minimizes diff output and that makes it
    easier to copy & paste or move lines around between fields:
     - Adding a trailing comma on the last entry makes appending new
       entries not affect the last one.
     - Starting the field value on the next line makes inserting or changing
       the first value generate less diff.
     - Indenting by one space, makes the contents movable between fields,
       and gives a unified format to all such fields.
     - Sorting makes the contents easier to find and easier to avoid
       adding duplicates.
    We cannot currently do this for the Go-Import-Path field, because
    dh-golang does not cope with this file being multi-line with an empty
    first line, yet.
  * Update .gitignore files
  * Set Rules-Requires-Root to no.
    This makes it possible to build packages w/o requiring (pseudo-)root
    privileges.
